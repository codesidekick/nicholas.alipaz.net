AdSense Content Injector
------------------------
Changelog:

[#1383494] by mcurry: Node enable/disable and minimum word count settings 
   non-functional.  Variable names were mangled during the 3.x modifications.

[#1342142] by mcurry: Add hook_uninstall() implementation to .install file.
   adsense_injector_uinstall() deletes all variables starting with
   'adsense_injector'.
   
   Add check in hook_install() implementation so we can uninstall prior version
   module variables (adsense_injector*).  See issue for more details.

                      
OVERVIEW

This version integrates a number of features I've been working on over
the last year or so.  It is intended to address issue #141096
"Inject adsense into content" - (http://drupal.org/node/141096) as
well as provide a platform for additional new features.

MAJOR NEW FEATURES as of October 6, 2011:

- Removed AdSense module dependency.  That's right, you don't need
  the AdSense module to use AdSense Content Injector.  If you don't
  have the AdSense module enabled, you won't be able to use the 
  [adsense:xxx] tags in your templates.  You can use raw JavaScript
  to inject Google AdSense ads.  Your choice.
  See: Issue #1301610 "Remove AdSense module dependency"
       http://drupal.org/node/1301610
  
- Now supports XPath-based insertion for inline ad insertion.
  The default XPath expression is /html/body/p[3] which will 
  insert the inline ad insertion template *after* the third paragraph
  of the node body, at the root level.  This avoids insertion inside
  nested (descendant) elements.
  
  At present, insertion is always done using ->appendChild() method
  of the element returned as a result of the XPath expression.  This 
  means that it's impossible to insert _before_ the found element. 
  This limitation may be lifted in a future release.

- "Top" and "bottom" insertion.  
  You can now specify "TOP" and "BOTTOM" insertion templates, which 
  will be inserted at the top or bottom of the node body, 
  respectively.  This method uses the body's 'content' fields with 
  weights (top = -6, and bottom = 10).  

  There is no way to alter these weights via the adsense_injector
  admin settings page, but you can set the variables 
  'adsense_injector_front_weight' and 'adsense_injector_back_weight'
  manually if you like.  (Note: These variable names are likely to 
  change in the future if and when these weights are exposed via
  the admin settings page.)
  
- Manual (per-node) insertion point specification:
  Now supports manual insertion point specification (using
  [ai:insertion:inline] tag).  The inline template will be inserted
  at the point where this tag appears.  
  
- Manual blocking of injection on a per-node basis:
  Now supports manual "no inject" (using the <!--ai:noinject--> 
  comment or other occurance of 'ai:noinject' within first 512 characters
  of node body.)  Note that HTML comments are filtered out by the
  HTML filter and other filters, so you might need to use something 
  like <br class="ai:noinject"/> or any other HTML tag allowed by
  the node's input filter.  (Oh, it would be so nice if Drupal's core
  HTML filter and HTML Corrector filter allowed HTML comments to 
  pass through...)

Installation notes and known Issues
===================================

BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS VERSION

If you've been using 6.x-2.x releases, you should disable node body 
insertion in page views before you upgrade to this version. 
This will allow you to update the module settings after you install 
the new version.

You will have to re-create your node insertion template. The template
syntax has changed (%body token no longer available). 
Copy your old insertion template into a text editor before you install
this version, remove the %body token, and update the template as needed.

The default inline insertion point is after the third top-level paragraph
of the node (this is controlled by the inline insertion XPath pattern 
field.)
